# The Greatest Book App by Eden

**Here is my Book Rating App (ReactJS + Router + Firebase + Typescript) !** 😁

It's a minimalist Book rating app designed in Neumorphism, allowing user to add books, rate them and add some notes. You can see your list of top books, sort them & add comments.

## How to run it

First, you have to add your Firebase Database link, by opening src > lib > api.tsx and edit this :

`const FIREBASE_DOMAIN = "ADD_YOUR_FIREBASE_REALTIME_DATABASE";`

Then run the app :

`npm start`

And create your book collection !

## Built with

- **Frontend** : Html, CSS ReactJS with Hooks (Router, useReducer...) and Typescript.
- **Backend** : Minimal configuration using Firebase Realtime Database
